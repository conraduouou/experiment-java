# THIS IS MY JOURNEY IN LEARNING JAVA

This is my 3 month progress of learning java, but only ever recording
my programming exercises from chapter 7 to chapter 14 of the book.

There were a lot of classes I could use in the back of the book
that I could use, maybe someday I'd upload them here too.

What's next, you say? You'll probably see my next language then!
